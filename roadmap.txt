## Project Overview
This application helps find missing people in public places by using face recognition technology to analyze uploaded video footage. The system will allow users to upload photos of missing persons, search through uploaded or live video feeds, and track potential matches in real-time to facilitate quick identification and location.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Environment Configuration
**Estimated time: 2-3 weeks**
### 1.1 Development Environment Setup

- Install code editor (VS Code recommended for beginners)
- Install Git for version control
- Create GitHub/GitLab repository for the project
- Learn and practice basic Git commands (clone, add, commit, push, pull)
- Set up a virtual environment for Python

### 1.2 Tech Stack Selection

**Backend framework:**
- Django (already selected)
- Django REST Framework (for API endpoints)

**Select a database system:**
- PostgreSQL (recommended for Django projects and storing facial embeddings)
- SQLite (for development environment)

**Choose authentication system:**
- Django's built-in authentication

**Select cloud services:**
- Simple file system storage for development (easier option)
- Consider AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for production if needed

### 1.3 Project Structure Setup

## Beginner Tips & Resources
### Tips for Beginners

- Start with small, achievable goals and build incrementally
- Use existing Django apps and packages rather than building from scratch
- Commit your code frequently with descriptive messages
- Ask for help in developer communities when stuck
- Follow tutorials for specific implementations
- Always prioritize security, especially for sensitive applications
- Test thoroughly at each stage
- Coordinate with frontend and face recognition teams regularly
- Use placeholder data while developing with the other teams


Note: This roadmap is comprehensive but should be adapted to your specific needs and learning pace as a university course project. Don't be intimidated by the scope - break it down into small tasks and celebrate each achievement along the way. Coordinate regularly with the frontend developer and face recognition team to ensure smooth integration.

how imagine the project : 
the project will be a web app made with django - i imagine it like this there will be log in and sign up pages once you once you log in there will be a home page/ dashboard and it and there also be another page for uploading pictures and footage in this page you upload the picture or the pictures of missing person/s and you upload on or more recorded footages also you can upload or link a one or more live footages and there will be some settings for the search like choosing priority or speed or someshit i don't know and there will be a search button once you press the search button it will open another page where you can the footage/s in video player/s and to see the progress of the model on each and some info like if there's a match in real time or not and the time when there's was a match and whatever if there more than one footage you can click on one to show it a medium to large video player and the other footages will be under it in a small to medium video players and once the search is finished there will be a summary or a brief that shows the final result of the search and small videos or frames of the matches with timings and shit - we have a team of 7 , 3 working on the backend and database, 3 on the face recognition and video proccesing model , 1 working on the front end . like you see i want the roadmap to just focus on the backend/database stuff don't i'm working on the back end so i don't want to be bothered with other things modify on the roadmap according to these

important note:
i'll feed you the instructions step by step but i want to alawys put this roadmap in your mind as a context to understand what i'm trying to achieve, always use best practices, use comments to explain and always document what we built in detaile
